### User Experience Designs

[Rezerve]()

This is a UX design I created for User Experience Final Project. Rezerve is a mobile application to reserve a restaurant. Users are able to find a restaurant they are interested in and reserve it at user-specified time. Users are also able to pre-order the menu before their visit.
